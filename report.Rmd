abstract: "We describe a time series model for the total electricity consumption of the United States from 2008 through 2018. We found that that an $\ARIMA(0,1,1) \times \ARIMA(1,1,1)_{12}$ model best fits the data and passes the runs, Shapiro-Wilk, and Box-Ljung tests.Applying the forecast of the model to 2019 through the present, we see that the actual data falls within the 95th-percent confidence band of the forecast. We take similar steps to model the electricity consumption of the commercial sector over the same time period and reach a similar $\ARIMA(0,1,1) \times \ARIMA(1,1,1)_{12}$ process. However the model no longer passes the Shapiro-Wilk test and the actual electricity usage in March and April 2020 falls outside of the models forecast."

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
